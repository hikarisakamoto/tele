> **Status:** Active development. Already usable for daily messaging — private chats, groups, replies, reactions. Some Telegram features are still in progress.

## Why tele?

Telegram Desktop, the web version, and mobile apps are built for mouse-first interaction. If you live in the terminal — editing in [Neovim](https://neovim.io), navigating with [yazi](https://yazi-rs.github.io), monitoring with [k9s](https://k9scli.io) — switching to a GUI messenger breaks your flow.

`tele` keeps you in the terminal. Navigate chats with `j`/`k`, open and reply to messages without touching the mouse, and run it over SSH on a remote machine. If lazygit feels natural to you, `tele` will too.

It also runs lean: ~35 MB RSS at idle vs several hundred for a desktop client.

## Installation

### macOS / Linux — Homebrew

```sh
brew tap sorokin-vladimir/tele
brew install tele
```

### Linux — binary

```sh
curl -sL https://github.com/sorokin-vladimir/tele/releases/latest/download/tele-linux-amd64 \
  -o ~/.local/bin/tele && chmod +x ~/.local/bin/tele
```

For arm64: replace `tele-linux-amd64` with `tele-linux-arm64`.

## First launch

```sh
tele
```

On first run, `tele` creates `~/.config/tele/config.yml` and prompts you to log in: phone number → SMS code → 2FA password (if set).

## Features

- Vim-style navigation — `j`/`k`, `gg`/`G`, `i`/`Esc`
- Telegram folders — archived chats, custom folders, persistent state
- Send, reply, edit and delete messages
- Reactions — view and send
- Photos — open in external viewer
- Chat search (`/`)
- Date separators and unread message marker in chat history
- Configurable via YAML
- Single static binary — no runtime dependencies
