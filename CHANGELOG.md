## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Foundational outbound-media plumbing: a chunked file-upload pipeline (with a
  progress callback) and a generic, type-agnostic `SendMedia` that posts through
  the same optimistic + update-suppression path as text messages. Also a shared
  `internal/media` MIME helper (detect a file's type, map it to a default media
  kind) and an optimistic local-media field on stored messages. No user-facing
  send UI yet — this is the shared layer the photo/video/voice send features
  build on (#128)

### Changed

- Desktop notifications now post through a terminal-native OSC escape when the
  terminal supports it (Ghostty/WezTerm/foot via OSC 777, iTerm2 via OSC 9):
  clicking a notification focuses the exact tab/window the client runs in, and
  the chat name shows as the notification title. Terminals without OSC support
  fall back to the previous generic notifications (beeep). Previously every
  notification went through beeep and, on macOS, clicking one opened Script
  Editor instead of the terminal (#17)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-15 — Message cursor & richer inline media

### Added

- A movable **active-message cursor** in the open chat: step bubble-by-bubble
  with `ctrl+j` / `ctrl+k`. The cursor rises to the vertical middle and then the
  viewport follows it (no jump), works even when the history is shorter than the
  screen (so the top message in a 2–3 message chat is reachable), and is the
  target for the context menu and per-message actions. Plain `j`/`k` line
  scrolling keeps the cursor on screen (#124)
- Static WEBP stickers now render as small inline images (with transparency,
  borderless — no message bubble) in Kitty mode; animated (`.tgs`) and video
  (`.webm`) stickers keep the alt-emoji placeholder, as do all stickers outside
  Kitty mode (#103)
- Round video notes (кружочки) now render borderless too — the circular preview
  and play/duration overlay without the surrounding message bubble
- `photos.max_long_side_px` config option (default 800) caps a rendered inline
  image's long side in pixels (#125)

### Fixed

- A tall image could render taller than the chat pane, pushing the surrounding
  messages out of view. Inline images are now bounded — long side to a fixed
  pixel cap and height to at most 2/3 of the chat pane — preserving aspect ratio
  and re-evaluated on resize; block-art and Kitty render at the same size (#125)
- A newly arrived message could be clipped or left unreachable below the bottom
  of an open chat (only its top border visible, "can't scroll down"), surviving
  refresh and restart. The viewport height estimate under-counted forwarded
  messages, so it never scrolled fully to the new tail (#115)
- Multi-line and wrapping messages were under-measured (the estimate assumed
  perfect character packing while rendering uses word-wrap), which could also
  clip the newest message at the bottom of a chat (#115)
- Opening or playing a large document/video could crash the client with an
  out-of-memory error — the whole file was buffered in memory. Downloads now
  stream to a private temp file, bounded regardless of file size (#112)

## [1.3.1] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- Scroll position indicators on the folders, chat list, and chat panes: a thumb
  on the right border shows how far through the content you are, appearing only
  when a pane has more than fits on screen (#14)

### Fixed

- Incoming reactions on your own messages no longer flip them to "edited";
  Telegram's hidden-edit flag is now respected (#118)
- Returning from idle no longer fires a burst of desktop notifications for the
  backlog of caught-up messages; only genuinely fresh messages now notify (#123)

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-11 — Mute-aware notifications, incoming edits & proxy support

### Added

- Chat list now shows muted (dim `×`) and manual-unread (`[•]`) indicators so
  these states are visible at a glance (#117)
- Connect through a system proxy via the `ALL_PROXY` environment variable
  (SOCKS5/HTTP) (#121)
- Messages edited on another client now update in place without a history
  reload (#42)

### Fixed

- Desktop notifications are no longer shown for muted chats or chats in the
  Archive folder (archived chats are now treated as muted)
- Mute/unmute performed on another device is now reflected at runtime, so muted
  chats stop notifying without needing an app restart
- In-place message updates (edits, reactions) no longer jump the scroll position
  when the message's height changes while viewing the latest messages
- Emoji reaction picker now responds to non-Latin keyboard layouts (e.g. the
  Russian `hjkl` navigation keys), matching the remap used everywhere else

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-11 — Reliable updates and history scrolling

### Fixed

- Messages and updates keep arriving after the app has been idle for a long
  time, instead of silently stalling until restart (#119)
- Fixed history scrollback looping between two dates instead of loading older messages (#120)
